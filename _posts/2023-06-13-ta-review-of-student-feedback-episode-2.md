title: TA Review of Student Feedback (Episode 2)
---

Whenever a class finishes,
students get an opportunity to give feedback to their instructors
by ranking them according to several criteria,
and also more importantly,
write a few comments.
Just like [last year](/2022/07/31/ta-review-of-student-feedback-episode-1),
we are going to continue the tradition of replying to some of these comments
that were given to me in the past two terms,
based on how interesting or funny their responses are.

## CPSC 110, Term 1

Now an experienced member of the teaching team,
I was selected to lead two labs
and to also assist Gregor in monitoring his online lectures.
It turns out that being a lecture TA is anxiety-inducing
due to Gregor's presence,
but is much easier than leading a lab.
I also had the pleasure to lead a Friday 6-9pm lab,
which often led to frustrations
as nobody, TA or student, wanted to be in that lab.

<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    "Boris was in my lecture section
    and fulfilled his role well
    with helping Professor Kiczales making Zoom polls,
    raising of hands, and question management."
</p>

Yeah, this really sums up my experience as a lecture TA.
Can't complain about this arrangement at all.

<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    "Boris is always very patient
    and always takes the time to explain things clearly and thoroughly
    during his office hours.
    Thank you Boris :)"
</p>

Lots of comments about "considerate", "patient", and "helpful",
which I totally did not expect;
it is always a welcome surprise
to see students enjoying the class as much as I do,
even though the material is often times painstakingly difficult.

## CPSC 110, Term 2

As I told a fellow TA before the start of this term,
I felt really burnt out from teaching CPSC 110,
and especially repeating the same concepts many times over
both throughout the week for different labs,
and throughout the different terms.
Nevertheless, a job is a job
and I must earn a living.

<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    "Piazza comments were vague"
</p>

Yep, intentionally vague.

<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    "Boris was always prepared to answer questions
    he motivated me at the start of labs,
    and I never felt like I was being judged or scrutinized
    when it came to grading problem sets."
</p>

<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    "Boris was always very helpful and encouraging!
    He made the labs more enjoyable
    because he seemed very interested in the course."
</p>

It is often a very difficult task
to walk the fine line between showing interest in the course material
and being too animated,
which might lead to students misunderstanding that as frustration.

## Science One (SCIE 001)

Compared to the class from the previous year,
it was definitely a lot tougher this year
for me as a TA.
Personally, I felt like there were a greater proportion of students
that merely wanted from me higher grades
instead of a deeper understanding.
Part of my job is to give out marks for the course,
but the other part of my job is the actually help people learn;
some of you might have forgotten the latter as the year progressed.

<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    "I hope that Boris can give more constructive and personalized feedback.
    Soemtimes students would ask him questions
    about the quiz reflection or written homework
    and he will just tell them to read the instructions.
    He sometimes assumes that we can understand things
    by just reviewing the lecture notes."
</p>
<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    "Boris was a well-prepared and knowledgeable TA
    who was at some times rather curt in his manner.
    This made him slightly less approachable,
    but he was certainly effective and did his job well."
</p>

I hope this is just a teaching style thing.
When a student comes to me asking about instructions generally,
of course the first response I should give
is to direct them to a resource that is already available.
I presume that if a student has a more specific question,
they will come back and ask that question again.
I will however admit that I have definitely lost patience
many times over the year.

<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    "Very kind and effective teacher.
    It would be highly appreciated
    if you would be more clear on expectations and criteria
    for written assignments."
</p>
<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    "...However, it was not made clear what criteria he was marking on."
</p>

Dear sirs and mesdames,
I unfortunately do not get to decide what the expectation or the criteria
will be for a given assignment.
If I had a say in it I would have written up a rubric.

<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    "...One thing that I wish were held more is zoom office hours,
    so that commuting students
    or those who are not able to come to the oliver room can still participate."
</p>

First off, I would like to mention that
there is no possibility for more office hours.
I am merely contracted for 2 hours a week,
and I am already going over that limit.
Secondly, my office hours are set during lunchtime,
which I expect most people to be able to attend,
on campus or commuters included.
If not, there is still the opportunity to contact me outside of class time.

<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    "Boris was always accessible and always willing to help us students out!
    He clearly always knew what he was talking about,
    but I put emphasis on the fact that he was always there for us students."
</p>
<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    "Easy to contact, always willing to help,
    incorporates humour into his teaching in a very effective way,
    very knowledgeable,
    took his own time to give review sessions before quizzes"
</p>
<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    "His office hours were always extremely helpful!
    He explains concepts in a way that was very easily understandable.
    He is always willing to help outside office hours too."
</p>
<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    "Boris was very helpful throughout the year
    with very useful test review sessions,
    lots of office hours,
    can bug him anytime in person or online."
</p>

As I said earlier,
I consider it to be an extra effort to be available to students
outside of class time and office hours.
I would just like to mention that this is not the norm,
and we do not get paid for such work,
so please respect our time when you approach us outside of working hours,
and do not place any blame on us if we are unable to be contacted.
