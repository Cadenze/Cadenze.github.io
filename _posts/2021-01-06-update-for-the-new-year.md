title: Update for the New Year
---

Happy New Year's to those to follow this blog. I hope you are well-rested, and prepared for a new year of challenges.

## YouTube

I have made a new [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-wRRCxbbF7wsd_10LZzUhw), hopefully posting my own performances and compositions. Nothing much has been planned for it, but please subscribe for more updates!

## New Year's Resolutions

I usually don't make goals like these, since nobody ever follows them; but after an especially tough 2020, it might not be too bad of an idea to make myself some vague guidelines for the next year.

1. Put a reasonable effort into school.
2. Make good music.
3. Be happy; don't be depressed (I know it doesn't work that way, but so far, forgetting about being sad keeps me going).

## For Humanity

I would like to take some time to recognize the troubles that the planet has been suffering in the past year. Maybe I am privileged and unable to understand the challenges of the poor, maybe I will never experience the discriminations of the minorites, but I hope in the future and in the present, we can work in toleration of each other, for peace, for progress, and for humanity.
