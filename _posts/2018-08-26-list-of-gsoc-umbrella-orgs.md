There was a recent email thread on the private GSoC Mentors mailing list about umbrella organizations participating in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program. I remember wondering about this as a student and thought it would be helpful to post this list for future applicants.

## Disclaimer

Three important things to note here:

1. This is not a comprehensive list. If you think this list should an include an organization, please feel free to [send a Pull Request](https://github.com/nikhita/nikhita.github.io/tree/master/_posts) or reach out to me about this.

2. List of organizations participating in each GSoC each year depends on their acceptance into the program. It is _not_ necessary that these organizations will participate each year. For reference, this list is as per the organizations participating in the GSoC 2018 program.

3. The term "umbrella organization" is still a little hazy. However, the [official definition](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/glossary#umbrella_organization) from GSoc says:

> A larger project/mentor organization that includes some smaller, related open source projects as part of their community.

## Shameless Plug

If you are a student looking to apply to GSoC and cloud computing, distributed systems, infrastructure systems and containers sound fun to you, consider applying to the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/)! :tada:

I was a student in GSoC 2017 and an organization admin in GSoC 2018 for CNCF. Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions about getting started, want to discuss about how CNCF runs the program or just talk -- I would be more than happy to share my experiences! :)
