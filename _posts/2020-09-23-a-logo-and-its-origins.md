title: A Logo and its Origins
---

A brand new logo has been dropped! Yay me.

Complete with a new favicon, the new logo also appears on the sidebar, which you probably have seen. But anyways, this is what it looks like:

<img src="/assets/logo_background.png" alt="Cadenze dome with light blue background" width="250" height="250" />

This logo takes inspiration from this small dome that I made back in grade 8, which you might have seen:

<img src="/assets/pfp.jpg" alt="Lampshade in the dark" width="250" height="250" />

It would not hurt to tell a story today, right?

## A Logo and a Lampshade

In grades 7 & 8, I had a class called Design and Technology. As its name suggests, there are two components: "design" and "technology". The design portion of the course had us draw out architechtural ideas, saw out different bits of wood, learn about the aesthetics of different materials; the technology portion of the course introduced us to laser cutting with vector software, how to safely use table saws, how to operate a drill, and a little bit of robotics.

The first project in my DT class in grade 8 involved creating a lampshade out of mainly laser-cut plastic parts. We were specifically told not attempt to attach the plastic edges to anything, since the teacher was convinced that it would not hold. Being the rebellious kid I am, I proposed to my group that we should attach these plastic parts perpendicular to each other, directly defying the teacher's orders.

Well, for once, my idea succeeded. The [finished product](https://goo.gl/photos/TGCP5tK81RumeHxy5) is what you see: a carefully manufactured 3D dome, while all the other projects produced mainly 2D structures. As defying an adult never turned out too well for us kids, this surprising result made me very proud. I did not get to keep my dome, but this became my first tangible thing that I ever created and showed to the world.

Which brings us back to the logo itself. Since I designed all the parts for the lampshade with the vector drawing software Inkscape, why not create a vector art logo using Inkscape? And tada, here we are, with a cartoon dome on my website.

## Small Update

Other than the new logo, there are also several small updates:

- The "About" page is now fully populated with my extended bio! I'm very glad that I can brag about my musical acheivements.
- The calculus notes are getting updated on a daily basis. I have decided not to make a separate document for first year calculus, since it covers mostly identical material as AP Calculus. Instead, I will be providing additional clarification with the knowledge that I have learnt this year.

That is all, I believe. Have a good night.
