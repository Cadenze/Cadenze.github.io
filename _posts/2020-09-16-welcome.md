After a few days of work, the site is finally up and running. I guess I should write something celebratory, or at least to commemorate the occasion. Congratulations to myself for getting a website done without writing a single piece of code myself. Yay.

Well then, you might ask, how exactly did you get this website up and running without writing any of the code yourself? The answer is simple:

* The basics of hosting a site was handled nicely by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com);
* The theme and layout was taken from [poole/lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), a GitHub repository; and
* All the troubleshooting was done by referencing other sites that have used Lanyon before me, incorporating their code into my build.

Being a first-year university student has certainly limited the amount of time I can spend on projects like these, and at the time of writing, I am tired and sleepy. I will keep this short, and after the courtesy "thank you"s, I will head to bed. Good night.

### Acknowledgements
This site cannot be built without the help of:
* UBC, who nicely provided a free domain for us students;
* GitHub and their users, who provided much of the guidance;
* Jocelyn Baker, who notified me of such an opportunity; and
* You, my reader, reading through all this nonsense that I cooked up in 15 minutes.

I promise I will bring better material tomorrow, but as of now, Cadenze, signing off.
