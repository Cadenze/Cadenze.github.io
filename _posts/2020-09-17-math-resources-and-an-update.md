title: Math Resources and an Update
---

As the title suggests, this post will mainly be about two things: some math resources and an update about the website's status.

## Mathematics

Over the summer, I've prepared myself for university and did some revision with my AP Calculus and Physics C notes. As a result, I have a set of condensed notes that doesn't teach, but rather remind you of those subjects. The calculus notes that I am posting today are available, in two separate documents, for both the [AB curriculum](/files/CalcAB.pdf) and the [BC curriculum](/files/CalcBC.pdf). They can also be accessed through the [resources page](/resources), which should also appear on the sidebar.

## Update on the site

Speaking of the resources page, if you happen to visit the site yesterday, you might realize it is still mostly populated by filler text and demo pages. By the end of today, the site should hopefully have:

1. A brand new [resources](/resources) page, complete with:
    * AP Calculus AB and BC notes,
    * A header to indicate my imminent physics notes, and
    * Potentially enough space to accomodate my music files, if they do appear;
2. An updated about page with a short biography; and
3. A small fix to my LinkedIn hyperlink, so it actually works.

## To-do list

Even with these updates, the website is not complete. In the near future, I would like to:
1. Replace the teal with a rose colour;
2. Make a more detailed about page;
3. Upload to resources
    a. my physics notes,
    b. my music recordings over the summer, and
    c. my earlier compositions;
4. (Potentially) a redesigned landing page that looks less cluttered; and
5. (Potentially) more links to my Instagram, Youtube, and Twitter.

Okay, now back to work. Lemme actually push those updates out.
