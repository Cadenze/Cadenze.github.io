I am Boris Li, a first year Faculty of Science student at the University of British Columbia. I am currently enrolled in Science One, a comprehensive program that covers all three main branches of science plus mathematics.

Beside science, I also consider myself a musician. I am a violinist and a composer, and I sometimes like to compose and record my music in my spare time. I also like to dabble in other instruments, including but not limited to: harmonica, guitar, and viola.
