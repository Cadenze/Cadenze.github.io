    "Look to the past, and see further for the future."

I am Boris Li, a recent graduate (BSc) at the University of British Columbia.
I am an alumni of Science One,
a comprehensive first year program
that covers all three main branches of science plus mathematics.
I majored in Combined Honours Physics and Mathematics,
and hold a keen interest in computer and data science.

Beside science,
I also consider myself a musician.
I am a violinist and a composer,
and I sometimes like to compose and record my music in my spare time.
I also like to dabble in other instruments,
including but not limited to harmonica and viola.
