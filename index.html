<p>A scientist, a musician, and a normal student discovering their aspirations. I can usually be found at <a href="https://discord.gg/eTtJwKJ">my discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Periodically, I write stuff: <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog">blog</a></p>

<p>Feel free to reach out for <strong>mentorship/advice</strong>. <em>This especially includes BIPOC and LGBTQ+ individuals</em>. I recognize I am still training myself, but I want to support those in earlier stages and/or considering these paths. I'll do my best to respond as soon as possible.</p>
