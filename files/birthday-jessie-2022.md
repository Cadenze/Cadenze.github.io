title: Happy Birthday

Dear Jessie,

*8th February*

*R4 Oakridge - UBC*

Happy birthday!
I know it's a bit early,
as you might see when it's dated,
but unlike previous years,
there simply isn't enough time for me
to sit down and write your birthday letter in a single sitting.
Days have been mushed together,
and I barely have enough time to rest up and finish my work,
so I thought the best way to do this is to write on the bus every day,
and hope it gets finished in time.

How have you been?
It really has been quite a bit of time since I've asked that,
so maybe seriously ponder over that for a minute.
I've realized it's very important to ask these questions yourself.
As you know, I don't think counselors are in general very helpful (for me at least),
so the duty of realizing your problems goes to your own self.
Even if you don't have the time,
or the energy to care for yourself,
they say identifying the problem is halfway to solving a problem,
so I would totally count that as progress.

Thinking back to last year,
I thought the tone might have been a little too stiff when I wrote your letter.
That's what online school does to you.
Too much time on my hands,
too little emotion to be expressed.
Getting screen fatigue consistently doesn't help me
(or anyone, in that regard) at all.
I'm returning to the stream of consciousness type of writing,
and I hope this sounds coherent enough, and not too casual.

As the bus turns onto Wesbrook Mall,
this reminds me to ask about school.
How has your workload been?
Did becoming an RA interfere with your productivity?
Before immediately shrugging off and muttering "fine",
pause, and ponder.
Birthdays are good days for self-reflection,
and if you've given me your time to read this,
I want it to be for your benefit.

Ah, here we are, UBC bus loop.
I guess I'm going to pause here and go to class,
and I hope you're having a great day ahead of you.

If you're just about done your day,
this section should feel familiar.
It's 9pm, and I've finally gotten back to the city
after an typical Tuesday at school.
At this point, I'm rather doubtful that this is "a day in the life of Boris",
but rather "a life in a day of Boris".
Days feel so damn long,
and this morning already seemed like weeks ago in my mind.
How did your day go? Tough? Exhausted?
Or maybe you're just breezing through the day,
since I remember you saying that academics isn't the problem in your life.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
It's really difficult to pull yourself out of an academic slump.

I'm currently starving,
it's been 8 to 9 hours since I've eaten lunch,
and between that, I've had 1 hour of tutorials,
and 6 hours of TA'ing.
I hope you're feeding yourself well enough.
Good food keeps the brain running at maximum efficiency and maximum duration.

Often times during these morning bus rides,
if I ever get a seat,
I'd immediately fall asleep.
Those few hours of sleep during the night never seemed to freshen me like before.
However, today's bus is packed,
and I thought, why not keep writing?

Speaking of sleep,
have you been getting enough?
Have you even attempted to go to bed before 4am?
I sure hope so, because I've been getting headaches every single day,
and it's only getting worse if I stay up.

I might've briefly mentioned academics earlier,
and I thought I might elaborate on that a little bit.
I haven't been spending as much time as I should on schoolwork;
there is just simply not enough time in a single day to do all these things.
I'm currently taking 6 courses,
and in addition to that,
2 TA jobs that take up approximately 12 hours per week in total,
and I'm also tutoring a high school student.
I'm very overwhelmed;
I wouldn't call it stressful,
because it's not,
and I think I'm juggling all these activities pretty well,
but I just feel so tired at the end of the day &mdash;
no, before the end of the day &mdash
that didn't sound right, about halfway through the day.
But in the end, it does pay off,
in the sense that it does pay the bills off,
so it's worth it.
Plus I get some spare cash to spend whenever I'm not feeling too great.

I've been making impulsive purchases more than ever.
A coffee, a burger, some snacks here and there,
at the end of the month when I take a look at my monthly statement,
I'm quite shocked how much I've managed to spend.
But to be fair, the prices on campus are quite inflated,
as students are forced to either travel into Vancouver for groceries,
or shop on campus;
must be pretty lucrative for the businesses.

And yep, there we go, I'm on campus.
I'll grab a Starbucks, head to lecture, and talk to you later.

Overheard some of my students discussing their Valentine's plans in lab yesterday evening,
so before I forget, we're talking about the bet.
There's little to no chance that you're winning it, by the way,
and as much as I don't want to win it,
it's likely going to happen.

I have not been able to meet any new people since term started
although I have to admit,
I haven't been trying.
The only people that I ever get to talk to are either my colleagues (fellow TAs),
or other people in my program.
And out of those eight people that are in my program,
there happens to only be one girl,
who happens to be Jocelyn.
So all I can say is,
mate, I don't think I'm getting to date anyone.

Not that I would even have the time to do so.
Ever since school went back to being in-person,
I have yet to be able to even do homework on weekdays.
As you might have seen from my typical Tuesday,
I get home late enough, after a quick dinner,
I would already need to head to bed,
since I would like to sleep around midnight.
That leaves all the schoolwork for weekends,
when people are supposed to be out "socializing" and whatnot.
I don't particularly dislike this lifestyle,
but I would certainly agree that it is draining all my energy.

On a slightly brighter note,
is there anything you want,
that I can help with?
Birthdays are supposed to be about you,
so while I appreciate the time that you take to read this,
you might want to find something else to do at this point.
I think we've done enough catching up for now,
so before I close this out,
I will wish you again, happy birthday,
and hope that,
for you and your closest friends and family,
are having a good day.

Yours,

Boris

P.S. I'm so fucking tired I really need to get back to sleeping on the bus lmao
