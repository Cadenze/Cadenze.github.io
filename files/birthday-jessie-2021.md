title: Happy Birthday
---

Dear Jessie,

I hope this message finds you in good health and among desirable companionship. Another year has passed, and another birthday has come. I would like to wish you a happy birthday and safety regulations permitting, hope you enjoy a day of relative uniqueness with your closest friends and family.

I would also like to take time and acknowledge the fact that these cards/letters have gradually expanded in length over the years. However, this year, I am no longer limited to the physical space of a piece of paper, and therefore, I will be writing as much as I want, so it seems like the word count will once again increase, no matter how hard I try to do the opposite. I also hope, after half a year of answering all my tests in point form and mathematical equations, that my informal prose has not diminished in quality. So, as I say every year, bear with me, and here we go.

19\. The age of majority in British Columbia. Over a night, you have magically gained the right to drink and purchase alcohol, buy lottery tickets and gamble, and to pay for and smoke cigarettes, although I find it highly unlikely that you will be celebrating by getting drunk, hopping into a casino, or heading to a dispensary. So how will you spend this symbolic day? I do hope you can afford a day off schoolwork.

Speaking of schoolwork, now that the term has started again, are your stress levels high? I might not seem the kind to have a want for mindfulness and self-care, but university is definitely a challenging endeavour, coupled with not too many ways to connect with other people, I can only imagine that you must be feeling the effects of another lockdown much stronger than I am. You might think that I am as usual, always on top of all my assignments; but I tell you, things do go awry a lot more often than before. I have always looked towards university as a way to focus my learning, to limit the amount of diverse tasks and assignments I have to finish; however, it currently seems not so different from high school, where I have to switch my brain from biology to chemistry to physics all in the span of a few hours.

How have lectures been treating you? I hope you are not staring at a screen 24/7, from lectures to schoolwork to Netflix. Remember to take breaks, no matter how brief they are, and try to procrastinate away from a computer. Yes, I know you procrastinate, and I know it is not particularly preventable, so I guess we can try to mitigate the negative effects of it. And have you been getting enough sleep? I know it is tough to focus on those long lectures when you are not physically in a classroom or lecture hall, and even when I am fully awake, those lectures sometimes just seem uninteresting, and your cursor just happens to click on YouTube, resulting in another lecture lost to your ears.

Have you been meeting any new friends online? I hope your class sizes are not too large, and despite the barrier of pixels, you can still connect with some of your classmates. I am lucky to have to a connected and active community of classmates, and a network of TAs that are always willing to help and socialize online, and I hope you have found something similar.

Speaking of people, do you remember the bet? You were almost certain that I would find a girlfriend by the end of first year. Well, now that school is confirmed to be fully online for the remainder of the school year, I find it extremely unlikely that will happen. Since you could not have predicted these the unforeseen circumstances, I offer you the chance to double down: I am almost certain I will be single by the end of my second year of university, and feel free to bet on the contrary. Terms and conditions about not intentionally sabotaging my own chances still stand, and the wager is still one paid meal. Deal?

If you have read this far, I am pretty sure you have realized this is posted on a site that you might have never visited. This is my personal website/blog, and I have been posting here for about 4-5 months. Feel free to browse and visit, I have posted loads of stuff.

Back to the main topic. Just like last year, if you want to get anything from Amazon or something for your birthday, just ask, but I have not specifically bought anything. I hope it is better this way since you will not be stuck with some junk that you have never wanted.

In previous years, I would almost always be limited by the size of the card and need to hastily write a conclusion. However, now that I have unlimited space, I find it much harder to close out my thoughts. I guess I can conclude with one of my favourite sayings, “Look to the past, and see further for the future.” As we graduate from childhood, it is an opportunity for us to examine our past and take responsibility of our future.

Lastly, I hope you have a wonderful day, and a wonderful year ahead of you. And once again, happy birthday.

Yours,

Boris

P.S. If what you miss about these cards is my handwriting, I have a [digitally written copy](/files/birthday-jessie-2021.pdf). Ask and you shall receive.
