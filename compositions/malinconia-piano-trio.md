title: Malinconia in D-Flat Major for Piano Trio
---

A piano trio, dedicated to Marcus Coetzee, Lexie Krakowski, and Charlie Dutton; thank you all for your participation in this project, it is very difficult to find performers in times of pandemic.

This is also my third and final project in my very first term of a composition class, as an exercise in writing polyphony and counterpoint for a small chamber ensemble.

Recording to be made available soon (pending performers' approval).
